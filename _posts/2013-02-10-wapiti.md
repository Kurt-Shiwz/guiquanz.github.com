## Wapiti简介

Wapiti is a very fast toolkit for segmenting and labeling sequences with discriminative models. It is based on maxent models, maximum entropy Markov models and linear-chain CRF and proposes various optimization and regularization methods to improve both the computational complexity and the prediction performance of standard models. Wapiti is ranked first on the sequence tagging task for more than a year on MLcomp web site.

Wapiti is developed by LIMSI-CNRS and was partially funded by ANR projects CroTaL (ANR-07-MDCO-003) and MGA (ANR-07-BLAN-0311-02).
